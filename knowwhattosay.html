				<h5>The Brief</h5>
				Mental health issues are a rising trend in Singapore. Our task was to help raise awareness on mental health issues in Singapore and help tackle them. The Client: National Council of Social Service<br><br>
				
				<h5>The Concept</h5>
				Those affected by mental health often face a stigma from those around them that whatever they are going through is a choice, and that they could get better if they wanted to easily. We find that people tend to say the wrong things, whether intentional or unintentional to those facing mental health issues and it affects them deeply. Therefore the concept that we went for are that the things that say stays imprinted.

		<h2>TV Commercial</h2><br>
		<div class="infocont quote">
			The TVC is the first phase of the campaign. It features no visuals other than subtitles and effects to communicate what is being said in the audio. The reason behind this is we wanted audiences to really focus on the things that are being said, and how they are being said.

		<h2>Print Ads</h2><br>
		<div class="infocont quote">
			The next phase is the print advertisements. A person is portrayed covering his/her ears with cuts illustrating the things that are being said to them on their arms. The concept behind the cuts is that it would essentially become scars, which are permanent, illustrating how those words "stay."
